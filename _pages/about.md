I am a second-year master's student at Tianjin University, focusing on Serverless, system for LLM, DPU and RDMA.

I was advised by [Prof. Laiping Zhao](http://www.clouduv.cn) from [College of Intellegence and Computing](http://cic.tju.edu.cn), Tianjin University. Before joining TJU, I completed my B.S. at Sichuan University. Iâ€˜m actively seeking a PhD position for Fall 2025 now.
