I am a third-year postgraduate student and will continue my PhD study at Tianjin University next year. My research focus lies in Serverless, system for LLM, DPU and RDMA.

I was advised by [Prof. Laiping Zhao](http://www.clouduv.cn) from [College of Intellegence and Computing](http://cic.tju.edu.cn), Tianjin University. I completed my B.S. at Sichuan University.
